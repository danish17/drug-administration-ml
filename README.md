Patients don’t respond in similar ways when the same drug is given in a standard dose. Several
factors can alter blood drug concentrations. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is used for
monitoring the drugs with narrow therapeutic index and marked pharmacokinetic variability.
Therapeutic ranges used in TDM are mere recommendations based on the clinical response of a
small group of patients taking the drug. Most drugs are usually assigned a single therapeutic
range for all indications, at all ages, and regardless of co-medication and co-morbidities. 
Therapeutic reference ranges should be population and indication specific.
A recent Indian genome variation consortium (IGVC) study of genetic markers in 55 diverse
Indian populations revealed high heterogeneity among the Dravidian populations and showed
dissimilarity with HapMap populations. It has been observed that 20.56% North Indian
population are poor drug metabolizers for the category of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6.
CYP2C9* 3 has been found the most frequent mutant allele in healthy controls and idiopathic
epilepsy patients of ethnic Kashmiri population.Due to these genetic variations, the references
ranges of drugs used in TDM, established elsewhere may not be fit for our population.
To assist the pharmacologists to overcome the complex issues of local population based
therapeutic ranges and predict a drug dose to achieve a specific blood level or vice-versa, this
machine learning model has been developed, especially for the Department of Clinical
Pharmacology, SKIMS, Kashmir. But any one is free to use it. This is the alpha version of the
model and will be updated regularly.
